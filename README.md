﻿# Predictive Analytics using R 3.5
This is the code repository for [Predictive Analytics using R 3.5 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/data/predictive-analytics-using-r-3-5-video). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
	Predictive modeling uses statistics to predict outcomes of events. It can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred. This course will introduce you to the most widely used predictive modeling techniques and their core principles.
This course will help you to perform key predictive analytics tasks, such as training and testing predictive models for classification and regression tasks, and scoring new data sets. The course covers the most common data mining tools, such as k-means, hierarchical regression, linear regression, association rules, principal component analysis, multilevel modeling, k-NN, Naïve Bayes, decision trees, and text mining. It also describes visualization techniques using core tools to visualize patterns in data organized into groups.
By the end of the course, you will be able to design your own machine learning predictive models using R 3.5.
